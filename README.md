Software Testing and Quality Assurance 

Course Description: Students will apply software engineering testing strategies and practices as part of the software development life cycle, including requirements analysis, verification and validation, and quality management. The creation of unit tests and analysis of various testing approaches will also be covered.

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Using comprehensive testing strategies such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing to validate the functionality of my code. Additionally, I can implement proper input validation, error handling, and secure coding techniques. Performing regular software security testing to identify and address vulnerabilities will also contribute to keeping my software secure.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program, I start by actively listening to the users and understanding their goals and requirements. By repeating these goals and requirements back to them and remaining in communication, we are able to pinpoint exactly what they are looking for in the final product. Using this information I create user stories and prioritize features to ensure that the program meets their requirements.

How do I approach designing software?
Once the requirements are defined, I prefer to break down the system into components. Breaking the program down into components that are clearly defined makes it easier to program to meet the desired requirements. I follow best practices and apply different software design principles to ensure secure, functional code.
